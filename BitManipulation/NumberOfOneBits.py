# Number of One Bits
# Solved
# You are given an unsigned integer n. Return the number of 1 bits in its binary representation.
#
# You may assume n is a non-negative integer which fits within 32-bits.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000010111
#
# Output: 4
# Example 2:
#
# Input: n = 01111111111111111111111111111101
#
# Output: 30
